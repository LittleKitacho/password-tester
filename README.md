# password-tester (Release v1.0.0)
A program for testing the strength of passwords.

Licensed under the `LGPL-3.0-only` license.

## Usage
To use you can either directly run the program, give it a password, and it will return the strength
as determined by my algorithm.  
Otherwise, you can import the file `stress_test` as a package and use it's `test` function
if you would like to use it that way.
